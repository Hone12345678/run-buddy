# lastMinute


## Description

- Motivation for development -  After starting this course I think we began to realize just how limited and valuable a commodity like time is. We wanted to create something that helps save time and take away the stress from something that should be fun and stress free. 

- Why we built this - As we've moved further along in our lives we've all begun to realize the importantance of time management and how difficult it is to plan things out last minute. With this in mind we wanted to create something that would allow us to plan a fun date night or just a fun solo night at the last minute with whatever we have laying around the fridge and whatever events are going on around us. 

- What problem does it solve - It helps plan out a fun night, and makes the best out of what you have at home and near by. 

- What we learned - As a group we learned how to utilize GitHub in a team setting, Leverage multiple Server-Side API's, and How to work collaboratively recognizing eachothers constraints/individual challenges to create a functioning final product.

## Features
- Search for recipes using the Recipe Match feature. This allows the user to put in the ingredients they have at home and the number of ingredients the user wants their desired dish requires.

- Search for local events taking place in the area. This allows the user to input there current zip code and desired search radius to locate events nearby.

- Storing the results of the selections in the Date Night page. Once the user has selected their desired recipe and the event they would like to see, the information they saved is available on the Date Night page. the Date Night page allows for the user to easily look at the details of the recipe they chose and purchase tickets for the event they are interested in.

- Independent usagae of both APIs. The user is able to make use of both features of the page but it does not require the use of one or the other to get a final result. If the user just wants an event they can just find an event. If the user just wants to find a recipe they can just search for a recipe.
